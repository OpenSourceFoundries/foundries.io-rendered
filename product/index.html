<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The Zephyr RTOS and Linux microPlatform products enable you to rapidly develop
and maintain secure, OTA updatable connected devices.</p>

<p>The microPlatforms are configurable, small footprint, open source software for
building connected devices, whether they are based on microcontrollers, advanced
multi-core SoCs, or combinations of these. Whether you&rsquo;re making a remote
sensor, smart light, appliance, robot, drone, or self-driving car, the
microPlatforms provide a proven, tested platform to build upon.</p>

<p>Open Source Foundries offers a per-product (not per-unit) subscription service
to the latest microPlatform updates to enable you to maintain your product with
the latest security fixes, updates, and new functionality throughout its
lifetime. There&rsquo;s no lock-in, and public releases are available, typically once
or twice a year.</p>

<h2 id="linux-microplatform">Linux microPlatform</h2>

<p>The Linux microPlatform is a complete software platform for developing an
updatable, connected, Linux-based device.</p>

<p><img src="../img/linux-blockdiagram.png" alt="Linux microPlatform Block diagram" /></p>

<p>In the Linux microPlatform, we provide you a recent stable kernel that we test
on a variety of SoCs, and a minimal runtime environment you can use to deploy
applications and services in Docker containers. Both source code and binary
builds are available.</p>

<p>The Linux microPlatform&rsquo;s minimal design is resource efficient, and follows best
practices to increase security through reducing attack surfaces. The
container-based application environment means you are free to use whatever
distribution image, packaging system, libraries, or other software you choose. A
typical headless product implementation with networking stack and supporting
Docker containers will use less than 200MB of storage.</p>

<p><img src="../img/lmp-gateway.png" alt="Linux microPlatform Gateway Diagram" /></p>

<p>Open Source Foundries delivers reference Docker containers as part of the Linux
microPlatform. These implement support for common device needs such as IP
connectivity to Bluetooth devices, CoAP and LwM2M, MQTT, network proxying, and
more. In our documentation, we show you how to manage these and your own
containers on your devices. Using these in your application, you leverage our
team of open source experts to reduce costs and time to market.</p>

<h2 id="zephyr-microplatform">Zephyr microPlatform</h2>

<p>The Zephyr microPlatform is a complete software platform for developing an
updatable, connected microcontroller-based device.</p>

<p>The Zephyr Project is a scalable, cross-architecture RTOS for constrained
devices, designed for security and with built-in Internet connectivity. The Open
Source Foundries RTOS microPlatform is based on Zephyr because we believe that
it is the future “Linux kernel of microcontrollers”. Like the Linux kernel,
Zephyr has an open governance model that allows companies and individuals to add
features and functionality and evolve the RTOS over time. Zephyr is licensed
under the Apache 2.0 license.</p>

<p>The Zephyr microPlatform includes the following key features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Secure bootloader</li>
<li>OTA updates</li>
<li>Zephyr kernel</li>
<li>Networking and communications stacks</li>
<li>Example sensor and actuator/control applications</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../img/zephyr-blockdiagram.png" alt="Zephyr microPlatform Block diagram" /></p>

<p><strong>Secure Bootloader</strong></p>

<p>The Zephyr microPlatform provides built-in support for MCUBoot, a portable, open
source bootloader for microcontrollers which supports firmware image updates and
secure boot. The image updater can roll back failed updates, and recovers
gracefully from power failures. The secure boot process only runs application
binaries you have authorized.</p>

<p>Applications using the Zephyr microPlatform can also be modified to use custom
security hardware or software required by the device.</p>

<p><strong>Zephyr Kernel</strong></p>

<p>The Zephyr kernel provides a small footprint, high performance, multi-threaded
execution environment for higher level stacks, libraries and applications. A
minimal Zephyr-based application uses less than 8KB of ROM. Complex applications
including Bluetooth support, Internet connectivity, environment sensors, and
logging can be implemented in less than 200KB. Zephyr is highly configurable,
allowing you to tune resource usage and omit unnecessary features from your
applications.</p>

<p><strong>Networking and Communications Stacks</strong></p>

<p>Zephyr supports a variety of network protocols out of the box, including IPv4
and IPv6, TCP (with optional TLS), UDP (with optional DTLS), DNS (with optional
mDNS), DHCP, and application-layer protocols including LwM2M, MQTT, and
HTTP. For compatibility with existing network-based applications, Zephyr
includes a BSD-like sockets API.</p>

<p>Zephyr also provides built-in support for a variety of connectivity solutions,
including Bluetooth (and Bluetooth Mesh) and IEEE 802.15.4. Support for WiFi and
new low power and 5G standards including LoRa, NB-IoT and LTE-M is
underway. Network interfaces can be configured to interoperate with Zephyr&rsquo;s
protocol stacks according to your specific hardware requirements.</p>

<p>The Zephyr microPlatform is continuously tested with multiple BLE and BLE Mesh
device configurations, and both the LwM2M and MQTT protocols. Open Source
Foundries will integrate, test, and deliver additional wireless support in the
continuous Zephyr microPlatform updates as they become available.</p>

<p><strong>Application Development</strong></p>

<p>Zephyr applications can be developed on Linux, Mac and Windows. Open Source
Foundries provides an out of the box installation so you can focus on your
application and not on setting up tools and configuring your environment. The
microPlatform installation provides additional applications for gathering device
sensor data, controlling devices connected to the MCU, and performing firmware
over the air updates.</p>

<p><strong>Security</strong></p>

<p>The Zephyr microPlatform is designed to enable simple development of secure
devices, with a secure boot architecture, signed update process and encrypted
data transfers. Using the microPlatform, you can provision your own keys
for checking firmware updates into the MCU during the manufacturing process. A
suitable source of entropy for secure network communication is also
required. You can also take advantage of any additional security functions
available on your hardware. Documentation is available to help you ensure that
your product takes full advantage of the provided infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>Continuous Updates</strong></p>

<p>The Zephyr Project is evolving rapidly, with new functionality added on a
regular basis. The Zephyr microPlatform tames these changes, providing a stable,
integrated and tested product development platform.</p>

<p>Our end to end testing and continuous microPlatform update process means that
you can focus on your application, leaving our open source experts to ensure
that the microPlatform remains stable and functional over time. With each
update, we provide detailed information on changes and new functionality so that
you are easily able to keep your product software updated, even between Zephyr
releases.</p>

<h2 id="end-to-end-tested-reference-system">End to end, Tested Reference System</h2>

<p>Open Source Foundries integrates the microPlatform software itself, reference
hardware, and additional tools to provide an end to end, open source reference
system that you can use while developing your product. Using this software,
which is provided with the microPlatforms and continuously tested by Open Source
Foundries, you can securely publish sensor data from devices to the fog or
cloud, receive commands or data back, and perform over the air updates to your
devices and applications. Both public and private clouds are supported.</p>

<p><img src="../img/endtoend.png" alt="IoT System built on LWM2M" /></p>

<h2 id="lifetime-support">Lifetime Support</h2>

<p>Open Source Foundries continuously develops, integrates, tests, and delivers
microPlatform and end to end system updates to subscribers for use in their own
products. These continuous updates enable you to rapidly deliver new features,
bug fixes, and critical security updates to your customers, at a fraction of the
challenge and cost of managing upstream development changes yourself.</p>

<p>Traditionally, connected device development uses long-term support
infrastructure, such as LTS operating system kernels, to manage and pass on
updates to customers. However, this does not address the entire software stack,
from bootloader to application. It is also slow and error-prone to back-port
security and bug-fix patches onto software that may be many years old.</p>

<p>Deploying updatable products allows you to deliver bug fixes and new features to
your customers throughout your product&rsquo;s lifetime, and provides both lower
maintenance costs and protection against software vulnerabilities and other
security threats.</p>

<p>By subscribing to the microPlatforms, you gain access to the latest fully
integrated and tested updates from Open Source Foundries. As a subscriber, you
are free to use these updates in your products. We will never “lock you in” &ndash;
you can cancel your subscription at any time.</p>

<h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2>

<p>We provide free access to the last public release of the Zephyr and Linux
microPlatforms. This enables you to evaluate our product and use the open
source software at no cost. We make public releases available typically
once or twice a year.</p>

<p>You may then subscribe to get our latest builds of the Zephyr and/or Linux
microPlatfoms. You can try out our service for 30 days at no cost and then
pay $1,000/month (Zephyr) or $2,500/month (Linux) for continued access to
the latest updates, security patches and new features to help you develop
your new product. You need a subscription for each end product that you
build and maintain, and there are no per unit royalties or charges.</p>
