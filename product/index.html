                        Zephyr has an open governance model that allows companies and individuals to add
                        features and functionality and evolve the RTOS over time. Zephyr is licensed

                        secure boot. The image updater can roll back failed updates, and recovers
                        gracefully from power failures. The secure boot process only runs application
                        binaries you have authorized.

                        logging can be implemented in less than 200KB. Zephyr is highly configurable,
                        allowing you to tune resource usage and omit unnecessary features from your
                        applications.

                        for checking firmware updates into the MCU during the manufacturing process. A
                        suitable source of entropy for secure network communication is also

                        The Zephyr Project is evolving rapidly, with new functionality added on a
                        regular basis. The Zephyr microPlatform tames these changes, providing a stable,
                        integrated and tested product development platform.

                            Traditionally, connected device development uses long-term support
                            infrastructure, such as LTS operating system kernels, to manage and pass on
                            updates to customers. However, this does not address the entire software stack,
                            from bootloader to application. It is also slow and error-prone to back-port
                            security and bug-fix patches onto software that may be many years old.
