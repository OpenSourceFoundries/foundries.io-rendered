      <description>Introduction The Linux microPlatform uses a set of Docker containers to provide end-to-end services used by the Zephyr microPlatform. The containers and their configurations are deployed using a simple shell script that wraps Ansible. The scripts require a version of Ansible with Docker support. Some distro packages such as Ubuntu 16.04 don&amp;rsquo;t have this, so make sure you install Ansible from a proper source before continuing.

      <description>2018 January 3rd Open Call minutes Highlights OSF is now 3 months old and the microPlatforms are reaching full speed. We are working on a few final work items before we move from limited beta to a public beta state for the Zephyr and Linux microPlatforms.
New BLE Dongle efforts For our initial radio technology, we have chosen BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) as it is the most mature and public radio technology that is available in both Linux and Zephyr projects.</description>
