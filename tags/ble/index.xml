      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever had to ship a product you know how frustrating a critical bug can be when your only driver is proprietary.  Many times the problem may be in your code and not the vendor&amp;rsquo;s code, but it is often a difficult journey to find the root cause.  Vendors have many customers and finding the right technical contact takes time, and without a compelling business case you may ultimately find that your use of the device is not &lt;em&gt;standard&lt;/em&gt; and you end up at the back of the line, even sometimes forced to find a different component.  Well with Zephyr maybe we are beginning to take a step forward, as we now have an entirely open source BLE solution from the host to the client, and there are vendors that are talking about possibly providing an almost &lt;em&gt;ready-for-certification&lt;/em&gt; Bluetooth low energy radio stack based on Zephyr.
