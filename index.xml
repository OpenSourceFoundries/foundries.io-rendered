      <description>Zephyr microPlatform Summary The most significant change in this update follows the Linux microPlatform switch to a Linux v4.14-based tree. This impacts compatibility with any gateways relying on the old Bluetooth behavior, and also will cause changes to the MAC addresses reported by the Zephyr microPlatform sample applications. Users of the bt-joiner container whitelist feature in the Linux microPlatform will need to update their whitelists. Specifically, the leading D6:E7 in the MAC addresses must be changed to D4:E7.</description>

      <description>2018 January 3rd Open Call minutes Highlights OSF is now 3 months old and the microPlatforms are reaching full speed. We are working on a few final work items before we move from limited beta to a public beta state for the Zephyr and Linux microPlatforms.
New BLE Dongle efforts For our initial radio technology, we have chosen BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) as it is the most mature and public radio technology that is available in both Linux and Zephyr projects.</description>

      <description>Zephyr microPlatform Summary This release includes a Zephyr tree from the the 1.10 development cycle. This tree does not yet include the conversion of the build system to CMake.
It includes an MCUBoot tree based on work done in the master branch following the v1.0.0 tag, which includes some work making it easier to port new boards to the bootloader than it was in that release.
Finally, several sample applications are included, with numerous improvements from publicly released versions.</description>
