      <description>&lt;p&gt;Open Source Foundries is excited to have an opportunity to demonstrate
our end to end IoT microPlatforms at this years Embedded Linux Conference and
the Open IoT Summit alongside the Zephry project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, the events will take place in Portland Oregon, at the downtown
Portland Hilton from March 12-15.  Open Source Foundries will be presenting
on 4 topics at this year&amp;rsquo;s IoT Summit.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>microPlatform update 0.7</title>
      <link>https://opensourcefoundries.com/blog/2018/01/25/blog-post-update-0.7/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;zephyr-microplatform&#34;&gt;Zephyr microPlatform&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most significant change in this update follows the Linux
microPlatform switch to a Linux v4.14-based tree. This impacts
compatibility with any gateways relying on the old Bluetooth
behavior, and also will cause changes to the MAC addresses reported
by the Zephyr microPlatform sample applications. Users of the
bt-joiner container whitelist feature in the Linux microPlatform
will need to update their whitelists. Specifically, the leading
D6:E7 in the MAC addresses must be changed to D4:E7.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How To Manage LMP Containers</title>
      <link>https://opensourcefoundries.com/blog/2018/01/17/201801-container-management/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2018 13:50:46 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://opensourcefoundries.com/blog/2018/01/17/201801-container-management/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Linux microPlatform uses a set of Docker containers to provide end-to-end
services used by the Zephyr microPlatform. The containers and their
configurations are deployed using a simple &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/OpenSourceFoundries/gateway-ansible&#34;&gt;shell script&lt;/a&gt; that wraps
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ansible.com/&#34;&gt;Ansible&lt;/a&gt;. The scripts require a version of Ansible
with Docker support. Some distro packages such as Ubuntu 16.04 don&amp;rsquo;t have this,
so make sure you install Ansible from a &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_installation.html&#34;&gt;proper source&lt;/a&gt;
before continuing.

      <title>Simplify your life: multi-architecture docker containers</title>
      <link>https://opensourcefoundries.com/blog/2018/01/17/201801-multi-arch-containers/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2018 13:07:31 +0200</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The great thing about Docker is that your developers run the exact same container as what runs in production.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what the Docker hype is about, creating reproducibile environments for applications. The technology enables us to create lightweight, secure microservices which run on an array of SoCs that can be updated over the air in a matter of seconds. We believe that accelerating code delivery will ultimately reduce time to market. Hype aside, Docker has matured and has become a foundational building block of our microPlatforms.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;OSF is now 3 months old and the microPlatforms are reaching full speed.  We are working on a few final work items before we move from limited beta to a public beta state for the Zephyr and Linux microPlatforms.

      <title>microPlatform update 0.4</title>
      <link>https://opensourcefoundries.com/blog/2017/12/13/blog-post-update-0.4/</link>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the final update for the Zephyr v1.10 development cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next update will be non-fast-forward update to the Zephyr
repository, to begin development based on the v1.11 master branch.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>microPlatform update 0.3</title>
      <link>https://opensourcefoundries.com/blog/2017/12/07/blog-post-update-0.3/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;zephyr-microplatform&#34;&gt;Zephyr microPlatform&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first Zephyr microPlatform update which uses the new CMake
build system, which has replaced the use of Kbuild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As described in the summary from &lt;a href=&#34;https://foundries.io/mp/zmp/0.2&#34;&gt;https://foundries.io/mp/zmp/0.2&lt;/a&gt;, all
users will need to update any out of tree application build systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;zephyr-microplatform&#34;&gt;Zephyr microPlatform&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is the final release which uses the Linux kernel Kbuild
build system. The next release will have a CMake-based build
system. &lt;strong&gt;All out of tree applications will need updates&lt;/strong&gt; to
their build systems to move to CMake. Refer to the Zephyr
Application Development Primer for details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.zephyrproject.org/application/application.html&amp;quot;&#34;&gt;http://docs.zephyrproject.org/application/application.html&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>microPlatform update 0.1</title>
      <link>https://opensourcefoundries.com/blog/2017/11/09/blog-post-update-0.1/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;zephyr-microplatform&#34;&gt;Zephyr microPlatform&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release includes a Zephyr tree from the the 1.10 development
cycle. This tree does not yet include the conversion of the build
system to CMake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It includes an MCUBoot tree based on work done in the master
branch following the v1.0.0 tag, which includes some work making it
easier to port new boards to the bootloader than it was in that
release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, several sample applications are included, with numerous
improvements from publicly released versions.&lt;/p&gt;
